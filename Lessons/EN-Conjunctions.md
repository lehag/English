# Conjunctions

**Conjunctions are used to connect words and/or clauses and are
sometimes also referred to as “linking words”.** There are two
types of conjunction (coordinating and subordinating) and
their position within the sentence depends on the type of
conjunction. In addition, conjunctions have three forms.

The most commonly used conjunctions are: **“and”, “but” and “or”.**

Examples:

- She works at a bank **and** goes to university.
- I like to swim in the ocean, **but** only if the water is warm.
- We can study now **or** later.

## Types of conjunctions

**1\. Coordinating Conjunctions:** This type of conjunction is used
when we want to connect two clauses that have the same value or are
grammatically equal.

**and, but , however, or, so, then, therefore**

**Position:** Coordinating conjunctions are always located between
the words or phrases that they connect.

Examples:

- She likes to sing **and** dance.
- I want to move to London **so** I am studying English.
- They are moving to Barcelona, **however** they really like Madrid.

**2\. Subordinating Conjunctions:** We use this type of conjunction
when one of the clauses of the sentence depends on the other
(subordinate clause); the subordinate clause does not make sense
without the main clause. Most conjunctions are of this type.

**although, as, after, before, if, since, so that, until, when**

**Position:** Subordinating conjunctions generally are found in front of
the subordinate clause.

Examples:

- I have been working at the bank **since** 2005.
- She is studying English **so that** she can move to London.
- They went to the beach **although** it was raining.

## Form

Conjunctions have three forms:

**1\. Simple:** a single word.
**2\. Compund:** more than one word that is generally followed by **as** or **that.**
**3\. Correlative:** surrounding an adjective or adverb, such as **"if ... then".**

Below is a list of conjunctions with their definition, type and form.
